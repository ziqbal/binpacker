Bin Packer Class
================

Description
-----------
	Given a set of directories/files and a bin size,
	copy/move the files to a set of directories so that
	the total size of all files in each directory
	does not exceed the bin size.
	Can be quite handy in situations where you need to transfer
	HUGE amounts of files and are fed up with counting bytes
	and you just wanna drag, drop and burn.

	Something to remember (you may not notice but...)
	If 2 files are the same then only one is transferred.
	If you don't like this feature then copy,paste rename afterwards.

	Tested with PHP 5 on Linux and Windows.

Disclaimer
----------
	This Class does not solve the Bin Packing Problem.
	It just tries for the 22% ;)
	If anyone is interested in the algorithm then get in touch.
	Bed time reading:
